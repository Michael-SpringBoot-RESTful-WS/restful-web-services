Best Practices in RESTful WS design
-> Think always Consumer first - make the proper and simple URIs to access the resources
-> Document your resources very well via Swagger
-> Make best use of HTTP
-> Make the best use of the request methods like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE
-> Ensure application sends back the proper response status codes as follows
200 - Success
201 - Created
400 - Bad Request
401 - Unauthorized
403 - Forbidden
404 - Resource Not Found
500 - Internal Server Error
-> Ensure that there is no secure information sent on URI like security token
-> Always use plurals as follows
 1. Prefer /users to /user
 2. Prefer /users/1 to /user/1
-> Use nouns for naming the resources as much as possible
